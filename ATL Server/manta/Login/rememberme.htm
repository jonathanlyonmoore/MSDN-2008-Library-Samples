					<p><font size="2">The MantaWeb &quot;Remember Me&quot; feature is intended for those individuals

					<p><font size="2">Remember, if you enable this feature, anyone that can access your computer's 
						account will be able to access your MantaWeb account.  For maximum security, we suggest that you do not turn this feature on.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2">To turn the feature off after it has been turned on: click the &quot;I Am Not &lt;your name here&gt;&quot; button, type your login and password, but leave the &quot;Remember Who I Am&quot; checkbox unchecked.  Click the login button to log in.  Next time you login, MantaWeb will not remember who you are.</font></p>
