<h1>Important Note:</h1>
<P><b>This sample is only provided to demonstrate features of ATL Server 
and should not be used in a production environment.</b>&nbsp; For example, this sample is not hardened 
against malicious input and performs no input validation checking, user sessions are 
vulnerable to hijacking, the database is stored in a web accessible 
location with weak permissions,&nbsp;and despite the fact that users may specify 
a time to end the auction, functionality is not included to actually end the 
auction.</P>
