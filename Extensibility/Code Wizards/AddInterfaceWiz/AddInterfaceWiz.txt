2.	Copy the three files in the VCAddClass directory to the Vc7\VCAddClass folder in the directory where Visual Studio was installed (for example, c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET\Vc7\VcAddClass).
3.	Copy the contents of the VCAddClass\ATL directory to the Vc7\VCAddClass\ATL folder in the directory where Visual Studio was installed (for example, c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET\Vc7\VcAddClass\ATL).
4.	Copy the AddInterface folder and its contents from the VCWizards\ClassWiz\ATL directory to the Vc7\VCWizards\ClassWiz\ATL folder in the directory where Visual Studio was installed (for example, c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET\Vc7\VCWizards\ClassWiz\ATL).
